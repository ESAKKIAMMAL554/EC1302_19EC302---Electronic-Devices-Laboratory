## THEORY
## ZENER DIODE
The diodes, which are designed to operate in the breakdown region, are called the Zener diode. The other name is AVALANCHE diode. There are two types of breakdown in these diodes they are Avalanche and Zener breakdown. In avalanche breakdown the, conduction in reverse bias is due to avalanche multiplication of charge carrier. In Zener diode is breakdown is due to direct rupture of covalent bonds because of strong electric field. The actual intensity of the electric field strength that produces Zener breakdown voltage. Avalanche breakdowns will have higher breakdown voltages from several volts to several hundred volts.

## PROCEDURE:  
## FORWARD BIAS 
1. The connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. The power supply Current Overload is kept at maximum and then switched on.
3. The forward voltage V<sub>f</sub> is increased in small steps and readings are tabulated. 
4. A graph is drawn between V<sub>f</sub> and I<sub>f</sub>.
5. The slope of linear portion of graph gives forward resistance and Q point is located. 

## REVERSE BIAS 
1. The connections are made as per the circuit diagram.
2. Multimeter current ranges are used to measure the reverse current.
3. The power supply is switched on and supply voltage is gradually increased.
4. As the reverse bias voltage reaches the breakdown voltage the current through the diode increases rapidly.
5. The breakdown voltage is noted before the breakdown and connection is changed such that lower range ammeter is included in the circuit.
6. Graph is drawn between V<sub>r</sub> and I<sub>r</sub>.
7. The reverse conduction region is extended to meet at a point. The value at this point is V<sub>rb</sub>. 

## FORMULA USED

**Forward Resistance**  **R<sub>F</sub> = ΔV<sub>F</sub> / ΔI<sub>F</sub> (Ω)**  

**Reverse Resistance**  **R<sub>R</sub> = ΔV<sub>R</sub> / ΔI<sub>R</sub> (Ω)**
